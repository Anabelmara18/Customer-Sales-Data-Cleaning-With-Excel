# Customer-Sales-Data-Cleaning-With-Excel
This project involves cleaning a mock customer sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. The original data contained inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues. The goal was to transform the raw data into a clean, analysis-ready format for further visualization and reporting.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **cleaning a messy customer sales dataset** using Microsoft Excel. The raw dataset contained several data quality issues, such as:

- Inconsistent customer names and missing entries  
- Blank or invalid order dates  
- Inaccurate or missing sales amounts  
- Repeated records and unknown values

The goal was to ensure **data consistency, completeness, and accuracy**, making the dataset ready for analysis or reporting.

This project highlights my **data cleaning skills** using Excel functions such as `IFERROR`, `TRIM`, `PROPER`, filtering, and manual validation to convert unstructured data into a clean and structured format.

- Data Validation
- Handling Missing & Inconsistent Values

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel
- GitHub (for version control and documentation)

## Cleaning Task Performed
1. Removed duplicate rows.
2. Standardized date format to `mm/dd/yyyy`.
3. Replaced "N/A" and blank cells with "Unknown" or appropriate placeholders.
4. Fixed inconsistent spacing in customer names (e.g., "Sara  Blue" → "Sara Blue").
5. Ensured consistency in Sales_Amount values (corrected missing or zero entries).
