# Customer-Sales-Data-Cleaning-With-Excel
This project involves cleaning a mock customer sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. The original data contained inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues. The goal was to transform the raw data into a clean, analysis-ready format for further visualization and reporting.

## Skills Used
- Data Cleaning
- Excel Formulas (TRIM, IF, ISERROR)
- Data Validation
- Handling Missing & Inconsistent Values

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel
- GitHub (for version control and documentation)

## Cleaning Task Performed
1. Removed duplicate rows.
2. Standardized date format to `mm/dd/yyyy`.
3. Replaced "N/A" and blank cells with "Unknown" or appropriate placeholders.
4. Fixed inconsistent spacing in customer names (e.g., "Sara  Blue" â†’ "Sara Blue").
5. Ensured consistency in Sales_Amount values (corrected missing or zero entries).
6. Standardized unknown values (used "Unknown" instead of "N/A").
7. Identified and documented duplicate customer names with different countries.
